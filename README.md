# SSA State-Level Disability Claims Data Cleaning and Replication

This repository contains Stata code for cleaning and analyzing state-level disability claims data from the Social Security Administration's State Agencies Monthly Workload (MOWL) dataset. The dataset covers the years 2002â€“2017 for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Data excludes claims processed in Guam, Puerto Rico, federal disability processing centers, and certain extended services teams.

## Repository Structure

- **data/raw/**: Contains the raw MOWL dataset.
- **data/final/**: Contains the cleaned and processed dataset (`ssa_state.dta`).
- **output/figures/replication/**: Contains the generated figures for the replication exercise.

## Files

- **`ssa_state_cleaning.do`**: Stata code for cleaning the SSA state-level dataset.
- **`ssa_state_replication.do`**: Stata code for replicating the results from Engelhardt's paper.

## Data Cleaning (`ssa_state_cleaning.do`)

This script performs the following tasks:

1. **Import Raw Data**: Imports the raw data from the Excel file `SSA-SA-MOWL.xls`. This can be found at this link https://www.ssa.gov/disability/data/SSA-SA-MOWL.xls

2. **Variable Renaming**: Renames the original variables by adding an underscore prefix to avoid conflicts with Stata's reserved keywords.

3. **Technical Variable Generation**:
   - Generates state FIPS codes.
   - Excludes specific records (federal disability processing components, Guam, Puerto Rico, and certain extended services teams).
   - Extracts and formats date information.

4. **Disability Claims Variables**:
   - Creates variables for different types of claims, including SSDI-only, SSI-only, and concurrent claims.
   - Calculates allowance rates for each claim type.
   - Generates variables for reconsiderations and continuing disability reviews (CDRs).

5. **Calculated DI Variables**:
   - Combines SSDI-only and concurrent SSDI & SSI claims into a single set of variables.

6. **Save Cleaned Data**: The final cleaned dataset is saved as `ssa_state.dta` in the `data/final/` directory.

## Replication (`ssa_state_replication.do`)

This script replicates the results from Gary V. Engelhardt's paper, "The minimum wage and DI claims":

1. **Figure 1**:

   - Figure one is from 2001-2017. One line represents the unemployment rate and the other being claims.
   - Code generates indices for SSDI-only, SSDI+SSI, and SSDI-only + concurrent claims.
  
2. **Separate Analysis**

   - Create local variables for SSDSI + SSI, SSDI-only, SSI-only, SSI DC, and SSDI-only + Concur.
